# devToolsExtension
Edge DevTools' native theme was getting boring and I didn't like it, and the rest of the themes weren't so great either (Don't get me started on the one that looks like the mcdonald meme color theme) so I looked up the color palette of the one I use on VSCode [Tokyo Night by Enkia](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=enkia.tokyo-night) and did an extension to also use it on my DevTools.
