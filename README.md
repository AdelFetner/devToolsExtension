# devToolsExtension
Edge native DevTools' theme was kind of boring and I didn't like it, and the rest of the themes weren't so great either (Don't get me started on the one that looks like the mcdonald meme theme) so I looked up the colors of [Tokyo Night by Enkia](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=enkia.tokyo-night) and did an extension to use it on DevTools.
