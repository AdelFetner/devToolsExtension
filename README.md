# devToolsExtension
Edge DevTools' native theme was getting boring and I didn't like it, and the rest of the themes weren't so great either (Don't get me started on the one that looks like the mcdonald meme color theme) so I looked up the color palette of the one I use on VSCode [Tokyo Night by Enkia](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=enkia.tokyo-night) and did an extension to also use it on my DevTools.

## How To use
To use my extension, you have to:
1. Go to DevTools and activate ***Allow extensions to load custom stylesheets***
2. Close it
3. Go to about:extensions and turn on ***developer mode***
4. Install my extension and upload it by clicking ***Load Unpacked***
5. Reload browser
6. Enjoy

## To do later on:
I will probably upload it in the Chrome Web Store, before doing so I would have to look that I'm not infringing any rights, but it would make the installattion much easier as it makes it unnecesary to allow the extension manually.
