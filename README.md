# devToolsExtension
Edge DevTools' native theme was getting boring and I didn't like it as much anymore, and the rest of the themes weren't so great either (Don't get me started on the one that looks like the mcdonald meme color theme) so I looked up the color palette of the one I use on VSCode [Tokyo Night by Enkia](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=enkia.tokyo-night) and made an extension to also use it on my DevTools.

## How To use
To use my extension, you have to:
1. Go to DevTools and activate ***Allow extensions to load custom stylesheets***
2. Close it
3. Go to about:extensions and turn on ***developer mode***
4. Install my extension and upload it by clicking ***Load Unpacked***
5. Reload browser
6. Enjoy

## To do later on:
I will probably upload it in the Chrome Web Store, before doing so I would have to look that I'm not infringing any rights, but it would make the installattion much easier as it makes it unnecesary to allow the extension manually.
